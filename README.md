Certain categories of sociological data have complicated relationships between causes and the studied phenomenon, as they are a product of non-expert subjective opinion with a large number of factors with nearly equal significance levels.

The purpose of this research is to apply the prediction methodology as accurately as possible to data of such a complexity level.

The object of this research is the prediction of scores from 0 to 10, which measure severity for 4 mental disorders: anxiety, depression, insomnia, and OCD, based on music preferences metadata.

The subject of this research are the machine learning algorithms that solve a regression problem: ensemble methods and the method of support vectors.

The result of this research is the score prediction algorithm developed in Python programming language and based on the best-performing regression model, which works both on the studied and manually collected data.

The key features of the developed algorithm are the speed of response and flexibility that allows to implement it as an additional feature of more global, full-fledged software products to improve their recommendation systems and create healthier environment for the user community.
